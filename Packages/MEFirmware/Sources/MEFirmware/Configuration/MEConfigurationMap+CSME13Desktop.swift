// The CSME 13 map of the ME configuration — emitted by
// `Skills/me-eom-structures/scripts/fit_map.py` from Flash Image Tool 13.0's
// own layout documents (the icl_h platform of ME 13).
//
// The family is the tool's own name for the platform half: `_lp`/`_p` is
// the mobile one and `_h`/`_s` the desktop one, and a dump is read with
// the one its descriptor's strap section length names
// (`MEConfigurationMap.forME(major:family:)`).
// Offsets, bits, the tool's own name for each setting (`label`), its option
// labels and the file paths are FIT's, copied out of its
// `ProcessNvar` bindings and value dictionaries; nothing here is read out of a
// dump. FIT 13.0 marks no setting `Auto` — it has no such attribute — so no
// setting here carries that mark.
//
// A generation's map lives in a file of its own: see `MEConfigurationMap.swift`
// for what a map is and why each generation has its own.
